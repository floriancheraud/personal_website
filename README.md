# personal_website

just my personal website 

It displays a 3D force graph of words from my diploma thesis in Architecture. Connections between words are computed using a python script for Natural Langage Processing. I've lost it but basically it links words according to their number of occurrences and their semantic proximity (co-occurrence).
