# personal_website

just my personal website built in 2020 using vasturino's 3D Force Graph repo. 

http://floriancheraud.com

It displays a 3D force graph of words from my diploma thesis in Architecture. Connections between words are computed using a python script for Natural Langage Processing (and an other one for translating the result in .json). I've lost it but basically it links words according to their number of occurrences and their semantic proximity (co-occurrence).
