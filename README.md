# personal_website

my personal website built using vasturino's 3D Force Graph repo. 

It displays a 3D force graph of words from my diploma thesis in Architecture. Connections between words are computed using a python script for Natural Langage Processing (and an other one for translating the result in .json). I've lost it but basically it links words according to their number of occurrences and their semantic proximity (co-occurrence).
